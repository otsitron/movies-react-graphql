# Video Store with GraphQL, Apollo, and React

To preview this Video Store, please run the following two commands from inside BOTH server and client folders (in two separate consoles):

1. npm install
2. npm run start

You should be able to see a fully functioning Video Store application on http://localhost:3000/ which should open automatically

If you want to test graphql queries and mutations, you can do so by going to http://localhost:9000/graphql and clicking on "Query your server" button.

This video store allows user to add, delete, like, dislike, sort, and search movies.
